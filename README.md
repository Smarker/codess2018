# Spark Streaming Twitter

You will have 5 challenges related to `spark streaming`. Each challenge contains
a description of what to do, requirements, and hints. If you're stuck, refer to
the `docs` in the hint section as they contain code snippets very close if not
identical to what you will need to write to solve the challenges.

The challenges involve working with a `live twitter stream` connected to
`EventHub`. `EventHub` will temporarily store ingested Twitter posts for you to
consume with `spark streaming`.
